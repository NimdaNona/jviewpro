# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for JView Pro

## 1. Document Overview
### 1.1 Purpose
This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the vision, scope, features, and requirements for JView Pro, a lightweight web-based micro SaaS application designed to simplify viewing, parsing, and interacting with JSON data, particularly from zip archives or direct uploads. The goal is to create a user-friendly tool that addresses pain points for developers, non-technical users, and small teams dealing with JSON exports from various sources (e.g., APIs, logs, game data, or productivity apps). By providing a freemium model with premium features like editing and multi-format support, JView Pro aims to monetize through one-time or subscription payments while maintaining low operational overhead.

This PRD serves as a blueprint for development, ensuring alignment on product goals, user needs, and success criteria. It is designed to maximize odds of success for a solo developer by focusing on simplicity, quick time-to-value, and differentiators that build on proven market validation from similar tools (e.g., the original JSON Viewer Tool's $70k revenue).

### 1.2 Version History
- Version 1.0: Initial draft (August 25, 2025)

### 1.3 Scope
- **In Scope**: Core JSON viewing from zip/direct uploads, partial free access, payment-gated full features, basic analytics, modern UI/UX, Stripe integration, Vercel hosting.
- **Out of Scope**: Advanced collaboration (e.g., real-time multi-user editing), mobile-native app, heavy backend processing (e.g., server-side AI), regulatory compliance features (e.g., GDPR beyond basics).
- **Constraints**: Solo dev build in 6-8 weeks; lightweight infra (client-side heavy); no external dependencies beyond Vercel/Stripe.

## 2. Business Objectives and Goals
### 2.1 Problem Statement
Users often encounter JSON data in compressed formats (e.g., zip exports from apps) that are cumbersome to view without technical expertise. Free tools exist but lack premium features like editing, multi-format support, or seamless UX for non-devs. JView Pro solves this by offering an intuitive web app that provides immediate value (partial view for free) while monetizing advanced access, targeting underserved niches to avoid saturation.

### 2.2 Business Goals
- Achieve product-market fit with 200+ users and $1k MRR within 3 months post-launch.
- Validate demand through organic growth via SEO, Product Hunt, and Indie Hackers.
- Minimize churn by ensuring sticky features (e.g., recurring editing needs) and low-price entry.
- Differentiate from free competitors (e.g., JSON Hero, JSON Crack) with paid enhancements like inline editing and exports.

### 2.3 Success Metrics
- **Acquisition**: 1,000 unique visitors/month via SEO/YouTube demos; 20% conversion to free users.
- **Engagement**: Average session time >2 minutes; 50% of free users attempt premium unlock.
- **Monetization**: 10% paid conversion rate; average revenue per user (ARPU) $5-10; aim for $300 MRR in month 1, scaling to $1k by month 3.
- **Retention**: 70% monthly active users (MAU) for premium; Net Promoter Score (NPS) >7.
- **Operational**: <5 support tickets/week; 99% uptime via Vercel.
- **Tools for Measurement**: Google Analytics for traffic/engagement; Stripe Dashboard for revenue; simple in-app feedback forms.

## 3. Target Audience and User Personas

## 4. Features and Requirements
Features are prioritized using MoSCoW method (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have) to ensure MVP focus for 6-8 week build.

### 4.1 Core Features
- **Must-Have**:
  - File Upload: Support zip archives and direct JSON/JSON-like files (e.g., .json, .zip containing JSON).
  - JSON Parsing & Display: Client-side parsing with tree/expandable view; syntax highlighting.
  - Freemium Gating: Partial view (e.g., first 10 items free, rest blurred); unlock via payment.
  - Payment Integration: Stripe for one-time ($5) or subscription ($5/mo) unlocks; basic localization (e.g., currency).
  - Modern UI/UX: Responsive design (desktop/mobile web); dark/light mode; intuitive drag-drop upload.
  - Analytics: Basic tracking (e.g., uploads, conversions) via Google Analytics.
- **Should-Have**:
  - Inline Editing: Allow premium users to edit JSON values directly in the viewer.
  - Multi-Format Support: Parse/view YAML/CSV alongside JSON.
  - Export Options: Download edited/viewed data as JSON/CSV (premium).
  - Error Handling: Graceful feedback for invalid files/formats.
- **Could-Have**:
  - AI Insights: Basic anomaly detection or summaries (e.g., via client-side libraries if feasible).
  - Saved Sessions: LocalStorage for recent files (no server-side storage).
  - SEO Optimizations: Meta tags for "JSON viewer online" searches.
- **Won't-Have** (for MVP):
  - User Accounts: No login; use local/session-based unlocks.
  - Collaboration: No sharing/real-time edits.
  - Advanced Search: Within large JSON (defer to post-MVP).

### 4.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Load times <2s for files up to 10MB; client-side processing to avoid server costs.
- **Security**: No data storage; client-side only; HTTPS via Vercel; Stripe PCI compliance.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 basics (e.g., keyboard nav, alt text).
- **Scalability**: Handle 1k users/day initially; Vercel auto-scales.
- **Compatibility**: Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari); responsive for web.
- **Localization**: English primary; basic support for French/others via libraries.
- **Hosting/Infra**: Vercel for deployment; domain jviewpro.com; no custom backend (use Vercel functions if needed for Stripe webhooks).

### 4.3 User Flows and Scenarios
- **Core Flow: Free User**
  1. Visit jviewpro.com → See landing page with upload button.
  2. Upload zip/JSON → Partial parsed view (e.g., blurred beyond preview).
  3. Prompt to pay for full access → Redirect to Stripe.
- **Premium Flow: Editing**
  1. After unlock → Inline edit mode.
  2. Make changes → Export button appears.
- **Error Scenario**: Invalid file → Friendly message: "Upload a valid JSON/zip" with retry.
- **Onboarding**: No signup; first value in <1 minute (upload → preview).

## 5. Prioritization and Roadmap
### 5.1 Feature Prioritization
| Feature | Priority | Effort Estimate (Solo Dev Days) | Dependencies |
|---------|----------|---------------------------------|--------------|
| File Upload & Parsing | Must | 5-7 | JSZip library |
| Freemium Gating | Must | 3-5 | Stripe |
| UI/UX Design | Must | 7-10 | React/Vue |
| Inline Editing | Should | 4-6 | Parsing libs |
| Multi-Format | Should | 3-5 | Additional parsers |
| Exports | Could | 2-3 | Editing |
| AI Insights | Could | 5-7 | Client-side AI (if added) |

### 5.2 High-Level Roadmap
- **Week 1-2**: MVP core (upload, parse, gate).
- **Week 3-4**: Payments, UI polish.
- **Week 5-6**: Should-have features, testing.
- **Week 7-8**: Launch prep, analytics, SEO.
- **Post-Launch**: Iterate based on feedback (e.g., add PayPal if conversions low).

## 6. Assumptions, Dependencies, and Risks
### 6.1 Assumptions
- Users have basic web access; no offline needs.
- Stripe/Vercel suffice for infra; no custom servers.
- Market demand persists based on search trends.

### 6.2 Dependencies
- External: Stripe API, Vercel platform, libraries (JSZip, JSON editors).
- Internal: Solo dev handles all (dev, design, marketing).

### 6.3 Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk: Low Conversions (Probability: Medium)**: Free alternatives dominate. **Mitigation**: Emphasize differentiators in marketing; A/B test pricing.
- **Risk: Niche Dependency (High)**: Like original, tied to specific exports. **Mitigation**: Generalize to any JSON; target multiple niches via SEO.
- **Risk: Technical Issues (Low)**: Large files crash client-side. **Mitigation**: File size limits; progressive loading.
- **Risk: Launch Delays (Medium)**: Solo dev bottlenecks. **Mitigation**: Strict prioritization; use no-code tools for prototypes.
- **Risk: Security Breaches (Low)**: Data exposure. **Mitigation**: No storage; client-only processing.
